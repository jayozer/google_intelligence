I preface this by saying all other team members were pleasant...I was initially quoted at $9000 for my 3 yr old son at which point during consultation I asked \"is financing available?\" They reassured Yes it is! Ok cool I'll do business. Fast forward a month later they call to let me know a next day 10am appointment is suddenly available with an anesthesiologist on board. They said if I couldn't take it, I couldn't my son in for months unfortunately. I asked before hand can you please tell me what portion outside of my insurance I will be quoted at...office manage states her computer isn't working...I said I'm patient I can wait I do not want to commit to something I cannot afford. 5 minutes later she quotes me at $2700 and some change that included a 20% discount. I took the appointment... they said an anesthesiologist would be sending an email with instructions...the email never arrived. I was only instructed on such short notice, no food 9 hrs before the 10am said appointment. The next morning they called at 8:45 asking if I could come in early since they were ahead of schedule, I agreed and arrived 30 min early due to living in Santa Rosa. No biggie! Upon arrival a woman who I've never seen before brings out the paperwork with the quote of 2700 and says all we need is to slide your card and he's good to go! I say \"okay how much am I being charged today\"? She says the full amount. To my surprise I tell her I do not have that full amount, I was told that I could finance. She tells me she's the office manager and they \"DO NOT\" finance payments what so ever. And no one would have told me that. She then asks how much could I do today and I tell her $500 and she says that's not enough. She then proceeds to tell me she will not be arguing with me about payments in front of other customers in the lobby then turns around and sees it's just us and the receptionist.....Odd how worried she was about the way she looked....She rudely says I can go somewhere else at which point I obliged. Then 15 min later as I'm on the freeway home she has the audacity to call me and ask if I could come back and that they would accept my 500$ payment today.

Our goal is to treat every patient and their families with empathy, understanding and respect. \n\nNow to address your complaints. Yes we absolutely have financing available and that is Carecredit which we mentioned during your consultation and again at the time of the appointment. \n\nOur office policy is as follows we collect payment at the time of the appointment. This policy has been in place since the organization began.\n\nWhen we consulted you and your 3 year old son the soonest date available would have been in May but because we were able to organize an additional surgery date we reach out to a few parents and offered them the option to come in sooner, so yes it was very last minute but it was definitely enough time to follow the NPO orders. \n\nWhen we schedule these types of appointments we always inform the parent that the arrival time may change base on the events that take place during the day. We cannot 100% guarantee start times. \n\nI then offered other options allowing you to not have to pay anything at all and to bill your insurance but you declined. \n\nOnce you stormed out we decided to call you back because I wanted to give your son the opportunity and care that he truly needs. We scheduled a spot for him that may not be available again until a few months out. \n\nAgain I apologize for the confusion and I appreciate your feedback.

They adjusted to his needs and we were able to do a short exam. They were willing learners . We will continue trying as it's so important for my child to learn to allow a dentist to check his teeth and do a cleaning. It's just going to take longer for him to allow it. I really love their understanding and adjusting their dental care plan to my childs needs. The team was open to learning about the way he adjusts and it was amazing. Very few medical facilities or dental facilities really take the time to understand what children with disabilities need and ate willing to learn from the parent. Most take over and act as if they know more about your child and it causes our kids to not have a good experience.  Each childs needs are different.
