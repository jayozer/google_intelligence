I LOVED this. He also got a great goody bag of products, (so did mom!!- extra bonus!), he got to pick a toy out at the end, and we even received the sweetest welcome letter in the mail after our visit with a Mickey Mouse sticker!\n\nAside from the great level of care, is the great eye the doctor has.

Everything is brand new, and they thought of everything, including a little kids lounge in the back area, and a TV screen on the ceiling for kids to watch their favorite movies while they get their check up! My son was so excited!!\n\n2) so efficient! Dr. Andrea is incredible and was able to assess both of my kids. Dental needs in a matter of minutes.\n\n3) so accommodating! The staff here go above, and beyond to make kids feel comfortable, and they have thought of every detail, including a goodie bag at the end to get them, excited about their dental routine, and a prize basket which my kids went crazy for\n\n4) very patient! My son was super tentative about the dentist and has a strong, gag reflex, but Dr. Andrea made him feel so comfortable and went at his pace.\n\nWe will most definitely be back and can't wait for our next appointment! My son was talking about the dentist all night long after we left \ud83e\udd23\n\nMy only suggestion is that they put some kids toys in the waiting room since I had to fill out paperwork for two kids while trying to keep them from getting into everything at the same time.
