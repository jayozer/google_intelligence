We were referred to Dr. Andrea because my daughter's tooth was infected and needed to be extracted. When I reached out, the person I spoke to was kind, helpful and thorough.  Since this was an urgent issue, they were able to get us in the next day even though they had a full schedule. Dr. Andrea herself emailed me back the night before our appointment with some helpful information about what our insurance coverage was and the membership program she offers.\n\nAt our consult, my daughter immediately fell in love with the office space and Dr. Andrea. Dr. Andrea is clearly in her genius zone as a pediatric dentist. She is very friendly and made my daughter feel at ease immediately. She explains everything to kids and parents really well comparing tools and sensations they might feel to things they have everyday experiences with.\n\nMy daughter received a card in the mail after our consult and she exclaimed, \"Mommy, you will never guess who this card is from! It is from Dr. Andrea!\" She was so tickled to receive a handwritten note in the mail from her dentist. This is above and beyond helping kids have a good experience with their dentist!\n\nWhen it came to getting my daughter's tooth extracted, she made sure she understood everything that she was going to do, let her pick out a movie to watch with noise canceling headphones, and made it very easy for her. After Dr. Andrea extracted my daughter's tooth, she asked, did you take my tooth out yet;-). Needless to say, she was appropriately numbed so she didn't feel any pain. Dr. Andrea has a basket of not-your-average dentist treasure basket and my daughter was thrilled with her \"prize\" and was also given a popsicle after the procedure. She also gave us some great advice on home care.\n\nPoppy Kids is the best dental experience we've had for our kids. If you haven't found a pediatric dentist you love for your kids, I highly recommend going to see Dr. Andrea at Poppy Kids.
